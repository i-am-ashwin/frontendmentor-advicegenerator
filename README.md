### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SVELTE](https://svelte.dev/) - JS library


### What I learned

Svelte makes it super easy to create smooth animation without any third party library
```html
{#key variable}
      <p in:fade >{variable}</p>
    {/key}
}
```

### Continued development

Svelte looks really interesting and simple I would look more into it.
